# Integer

Move supports six unsigned integer types: `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`, and `u256`. Values of these types range from 0 to a maximum that depends on the size of the type.

Although math can be done easily among integers of the same type, it's not possible to do math directly between integers of different types

    ```rust showLineNumbers
    fun plus_two_types(): u64 {
        let x: u8 = 10;
        let y: u64 = 60;
        // This will error
        x + y // x and y are different types -> failed to compile
    }
    ```

To make this expression correct, you need to use two identical data types; we will convert one of the two data types to match the other.

    ```rust {4} showLineNumbers
    fun plus_two_types(): u64 {
        let x: u8 = 10;
        let y: u64 = 60;
        (x as u64) + y
    }
    ```

    :::warning
    One of the things to pay attention to when using type casting, like the code above, is that we should only cast smaller types to larger types, and not the other way around. This helps to limit the risk of overflow.

# Code Start
This code defines a module in Move language that includes a function plus_two_types, which adds a u8 and a u64 after converting the u8 to u64. The module also contains a test function test_plus_two_types that verifies the addition operation.
  ```rust title="sources/movement.move" showLineNumbers
  module movement::MovementModule {
      use std::debug::print;

      fun plus_two_types(x: u8, y: u64): u64 {
          (x as u64) + y
      }

      #[test]
      fun test_plus_two_types() {
          let result = plus_two_types(5, 100);
          print(&result);
      }
  }
  ```
> Execute test in the terminal
```bash title="Run Test on termial"
