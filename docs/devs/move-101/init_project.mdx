# Install Movement CLI
:::note
- Ensure you have [Installed Movement CLI](/devs/getstarted.md#)
- If you want to learn more about the Move Programming Language in depth, you should visit [this link](https://hack.movementlabs.xyz).
:::

## Step 1: Initialize the Movement Environment
Open your command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project. Then, initialize the CLI with the following command:
<Tabs groupId="system">
    <TabItem value="movement" label="Movement CLI" default>
        ```bash title="Terminal"
        movement init --skip-faucet --network custom --rest-url https://aptos.testnet.suzuka.movementlabs.xyz/v1
        ```
        :::info
        Due to current network load, we have restricted the faucet API to only accept requests from a Web UI. You must include the `--skip-faucet` flag. The CLI cannot fund the account immediately, so it will not create an account for you automatically.
        :::

        ### CLI Prompts
        #### 1. Choose Network
        > You'll be prompted to select a network:
        ```bash title="Enter to choose default network"
        Choose network from [devnet, testnet, local, custom | defaults to devnet]:
        ```

        #### 2. Enter Private Key
        > You'll be asked to enter your private key
        ```bash title="Enter to generate a new one"
        Enter your private key as a hex literal (0x...) [Current: Redacted | No input: Generate new key (or keep one if present)]
        ```
        - If you have an existing private key, enter it now.
        - If not, simply press **Enter** to generate a new one.
        #### 3. Initialization Success
        > After completing the prompts, you should see a message like:
        ```
        Movement CLI is now set up for account 0xYOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS as profile default!
See the account here: https://explorer.movementlabs.xyz/account/0xYOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS?network=testnet
Run `movement --help` for more information about commands
{
  "Result": "Success"
}
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="aptos" label="Aptos CLI" default>
        ```bash title="Terminal"
        aptos init --skip-faucet --network custom --rest-url https://aptos.testnet.suzuka.movementlabs.xyz/v1
        ```

## Step 2: Scaffold the Move Project
> Now, let's set up the structure for your Move module.
### Initialize the Move Project
<Tabs groupId="system">
    <TabItem value="movement" label="Movement CLI" default>
        ```bash title="Run the floowing command on Terminal"
        movement move init --name hello_blockchain
        ```
        ```bash title="Folders and files for your Move project"
        ├── .movement            // Configuration file for your Move project.
           ├── config.yaml
        ├── Move.toml         // Configuration file for your Move project.
        ├── scripts           // Directory for transaction scripts (optional).
        ├── sources           // Directory where you'll write your Move modules.
        └── tests             // Directory for writing unit tests.
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="aptos" label="Aptos CLI">
        ```bash title="Run the floowing command on Terminal"
        aptos move init --name hello_blockchain
        ```
        ```bash title="Folders and files for your Move project"
        ├── .aptos            // Directory for your Move Environment.
        │   └── config.yaml   // Environemtn Configuration file for your move project
        ├── Move.toml         // Configuration file for your Move project.
        ├── scripts           // Directory for transaction scripts (optional).
        ├── sources           // Directory where you'll write your Move modules.
        └── tests             // Directory for writing unit tests.
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 3: Fund Your Account
> Before deploying contracts, you'll need testnet tokens.
  1. Copy Your Account Address
     - Make note of your account address from the initialization success message or inside the `./aptos/config.yaml` file
     ```yaml showLineNumbers
     ---
     profiles:
       default:
         network: Testnet/Custom/Devnet/Mainnet
         private_key: "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"
         public_key: "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"
         account: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS
         rest_url: "https://aptos.testnet.suzuka.movementlabs.xyz/v1/"
         faucet_url: "https://faucet.testnet.suzuka.movementlabs.xyz/" (optional)
     ```
  2. Visit the Faucet & Request tokens
    - Go to the [Movement Labs Web Faucet](https://faucet.movementlabs.xyz/?network=aptos) to fund your account
  3. Check your tokens
     <Tabs groupId="system">
        <TabItem value="movement" label="Movement CLI" default>
            ```bash
            movement account balance --account ${YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY}
            ```
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem value="aptos" label="Aptos CLI">
            ```bash
            aptos account balance --account ${YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY}
            ```
        </TabItem>
     </Tabs>
     ```json showLineNumbers
     {
       "Result": [
         {
           "asset_type": "coin",
           "coin_type": "0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin",
           "balance": 999999700
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

> This is how you initialize a project on Movement through the Movement CLI or Aptos CLI. In the following sections, we will work together to implement contracts, create resources, and modules in the clearest way possible.
