# Getting Started

There are currently three environments for connecting to the Movement Network. Deciding which environment to connect to is as simple as understanding: what language are you developing in? There are environments for Aptos, EVM, and Sui. 

The fastest way to start building on Movement is by interacting with our Testnetwork, if you already know your way around any of these ecosystems refer to our [Network Endpoints](/devs/networkEndpoints)

## Aptos

The Aptos Environment is currently accessible through the Suzuka Testnet.

If you're building with Aptos move refer to [Install Aptos CLI](https://aptos.dev/en/build/cli#-install-the-aptos-cli) to get started. 

Get all of the necessary [endpoints](/devs/networkEndpoints#aptos-environment) to start building.

Get started with our [Aptos Tutorials](/devs/tutorials/Deploy/aptosmodule).


## MEVM

The MEVM environment is currently accessible through the Imola Testnet.

If you're building with Solidity check out our section for [Ethereum Developers](/category/evm-contracts).

Get all of the necessary [endpoints](/devs/networkEndpoints#evm-environment) to start building.

## Sui

The Sui environment is currently accessible through the sui Imola Testnet.

If you're building with Sui Move check out our section for [Sui Developers](/devs/tutorials/Deploy/suimodule)

Get all of the necessary [endpoints](/devs/networkEndpoints#sui-environment) to start building.

## Faucet 

Refer to our documentation on [Faucets](/general/UsingMovement/faucet) to get started building with testnet tokens.

## Learning Move 

If you are new to Movement, head to [Hack Movement](https://hack.movementlabs.xyz/), a crash course on developing for Movement, or [Move Language](https://aptos.dev/en/build/smart-contracts/book) to learn about the basics.

## Tutorials

We have a few [tutorials](/category/tutorials) available for you to try things out! Head to Tutorials and start hacking.
